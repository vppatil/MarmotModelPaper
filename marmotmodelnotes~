marmot model paper

1) look up ltre vs. reverse time models
2) lookup stochastic ltre paper again
3) fix hypotheses for objectives

1) compare ltre and reverse time modeling -reread cooch et al 2001

2) quantify influence of climate-mediated survival in pikas and marmots- did you already cite the papers saying that they were affected? yes

3) determine why pikas and marmots follow different trajectories
